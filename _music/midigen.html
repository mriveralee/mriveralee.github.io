  As part of a Computer Music Systems and Info Processing course at Carnegie
  Mellon University, I made an application called Midigen that algorithmically
  creates multi-instrument music and visuals for it. The application also offers
  interactive controls for tempo, pitch bend, and sound synthesis through
  TouchOSC on Android.
