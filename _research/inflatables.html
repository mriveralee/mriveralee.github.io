  In this paper, we explore the future of designing room-scale deployable structures that can be fabricated with interaction and thus be responsive to human input and environments. We demonstrate three types of sensing methods — acoustic, capacitive and pressure —in order to embed input into our structures. Our sensing methods enable users to perform gestures such as knock, squeeze and swipe with specific parts of our fabricated structure such as doors, windows, etc. and make them interactive. As exemplars, we design a responsive canopy, an interactive geodesic dome and a portable table. All our designs are based on inflatable trusses which are custom fabricated for a particular purpose.  These can be deployed from a compact deflated state to a much larger inflated state which takes on a desired form and provides desired interactivity.
