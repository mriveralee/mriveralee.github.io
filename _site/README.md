My website based on *folio, a simple theme for showcasing your work, emphasis on whitespace, transparency, and helvetica.

Images for projects use the following sizes:
 * high: 3600 x 2400
 * low: 600 x 400
 * teaser 536 x 357

This repo uses custom jekyll plug-ins and therefore is pushed differently.
