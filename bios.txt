I am a Ph.D. candidate at the <a href="{{ site.cmuHCIIDeptWebsiteUrl }}" target="_blank">Human-Computer Interaction Institute</a> in the School of Computer Science of <a href="{{ site.cmuWebsiteUrl }}" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I am advised by <a href="{{ site.scottHudsonUrl }}" target="_blank">Scott Hudson</a> at the <a href="{{site.devlabWebsiteUrl }}" target="_blank">DevLab</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
My research sits at the intersection of technical human-computer interaction (HCI), material science and digital fabrication. I develop new capabilities for digital fabrication technologies like 3D printers, and explore how they might better serve the people who use them.
<br/>
<br/>
To this end, I have introduced fabrication techniques for materials that are soft, compliant, or environmentally-sustainable while demonstrating applications in sensing, actuation, and interactive devices. I supplement these techniques with open-source hardware designs and software tools to make them useful and approachable to end-users.
<br/>
<br/>
During my Ph.D. program, I interned at <a href="https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-labs/index.html" target="_blank">HP Labs</a> in the Immersive Experiences Lab. Before Carnegie Mellon, I completed a M.S.E in <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/cggt.html" target="_blank">Computer Graphics and Game Technology</a> and a B.S.E in <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd.html" target="_blank">Digital Media Design</a> at the <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a>. I was also a software engineer at <a href="https://about.fb.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin" target="_blank"> LinkedIn</a>.
